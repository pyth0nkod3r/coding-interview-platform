# Design Aesthetics,
Use Rich Aesthetics: The USER should be wowed at first glance by the design. Use best practices in modern web design (e.g. vibrant colors, glassmorphism, and dynamic animations) to create a stunning first impression. Failure to do this is UNACCEPTABLE.
Prioritize Visual Excellence: Implement designs that will WOW the user and feel extremely premium: - Avoid generic colors (plain red, blue, green). Use curated, harmonious color palettes (e.g., HSL tailored colors, sleek dark modes).
Using modern typography (e.g., from Google Fonts like Inter, Roboto, or Outfit) instead of browser defaults.
Use smooth gradients,
Add subtle micro-animations for enhanced user experience,
Use a Dynamic Design: An interface that feels responsive and alive encourages interaction. Achieve this with hover effects and interactive elements. Micro-animations, in particular, are highly effective for improving user engagement.
Premium Designs. Make a design that feels premium and state of the art. Avoid creating simple minimum viable products.
Don't use placeholders. If you need an image, use your generate_image tool to create a working demonstration.

Regularly commit code to git.
